How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

    Taking user input is one of the most important things when developing something. Having their opinions and suggestiosn be implemented makes them happier 
    and an overall more successful product. User stories were used to help interpret what feedback should be taken and how it should be implemented.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

    Agile is an extremely useful way to approach a project. It allows for dynamic edits and changes to me made while in development instead of having to 
    backtrack. In future development Agile will help me determine what needs to be done first, and how long it will take, which will help me get the project
    done in a timely manner.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

    Being a good team member in software development means many things. It means being respectful, doing your part, and helping others do theirs. Attending 
    meetings on time and meeting expectations are also important in being a good team member.
